> Python modules for different tasks:
> - separating articles in (historical) newspapers or similar documents (`article_separation`)
> - measuring the performance of article separation algorithms (`article_separation_measure`)
> - utility functions, e.g. for plotting images together with metadata information (`python_util`)
